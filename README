tax2tree v1.0
-------------
tax2tree assists in decorating an existing taxonomy onto a phylogenetic tree
with overlapping tip names.

An example test tree and input consensus set can be found in tests/data. Once
tax2tree is installed and paths are setup appropriately (see INSTALL), you can
run the following to reproduce the output seen in Figure 1 (REF)

$ nlevel -t tests/data/test.ntree -m tests/data/tests.con -o test_output
